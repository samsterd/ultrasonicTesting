# A set of functions to run in order to set parameters for a scan
# This includes:
#   singlePulseMeasure - turns on pulser, takes a measurement with the picoscope at given parameters, outputs a plot
#   repositionEnder - connects to Ender, moves, and disconnects so that it can be positioned at the starting point of a scan
# This interface should be improved to better match setup protocols
